Max was given the task of solving a puzzle at school.
His teacher gave him a long list of numbers to help him.

A shortened version of this list might look like this:
```
123 345 36
789 24 1324
126 654 456
1432 278 56
664 432 88
```

Each line contains 3 positive integers.
His task is to find the greatest common divisor of these three numbers.
If the greatest common divisor is a prime number, it should be added to the total result.

An example using the numbers above:
- The greatest common divisor of `123 345 36` is `3`. `3` is a prime number, which means that the total result is increased by 3.
- The greatest common divisor of `789 24 1324` is `2`. `2` is a prime number, which means that the total result is increased by 2.
- The greatest common divisor of `126 654 456` is `6`. `6` is not a prime number, which means that the total result is not increased.
- The greatest common divisor of `1432 278 56` is `2`. `2` is a prime number, which means that the total result is increased by 2.
- The greatest common divisor of `664,432,88` is `8`. `8` is not a prime number, which means that the total result is not increased.

- The result would be **7**.

What would be the result of the sets of numbers in `input1.txt`, `input2.txt`, and `input3.txt`?
