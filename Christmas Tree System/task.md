David has developed a system for decorating his Christmas tree in a similar way every year.
First, he looks at all the baubles on the tree from a certain perspective.
Then he looks at each bauble from left to right and writes down a different number depending on the color of the bauble.
This gives him a number that he can use to decorate his Christmas tree in a similar way next year.

His friend Bob has also come up with his own system for decorating his Christmas tree in exactly the same way every year.
He goes through the tree layer by layer from top to bottom and then writes down from left to right:
- a `#` if there is no bauble hanging at that point on the Christmas tree
- a number depending on the color of the bauble if there is a bauble hanging there

David liked Bob's tree from last year and would therefore like to convert the information from Bob's system into his own system.

Bob's information could look like this:
```
##2#5##9#
```

In order for David to convert the system, he first wants to represent the tree with the baubles:
```
  #
 #2#
5##9#
```

Now he can easily read the numbers of the balls from left to right and get 529.

What would the Christmas trees from `input1.txt`, `input2.txt`, and `input3.txt` look like in David's system?
